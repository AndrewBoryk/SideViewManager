# SideViewManager

## v0.5.0
#### Added:
* Intuitive handling for movement of sideView when adjusting offset, so that the swipe follows the movement of their finger along the screen no matter the starting and ending frame.
* Travis-CI

#### Changed:
* Updated `offScreenFrame` to be `startingFrame` and `onScreenFrame` to be `endingFrame`, in order to make more sense and generic (developers may not choose to have the sideView move on and off screen).

## v0.4.0
#### Added:
* Added README documentation

#### Changed:
* Changed the parameter label for initializing using a UIViewController from `sideController` to `controller`.

## v0.1.0
#### Initial Release
